                    <h2 class="article-subheader">My Dissertation Journey</h2>
                    <p class="article-content">
                        As part of my academic journey, I completed a dissertation titled “An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of In-Real-Life 
                        Factors as a Source Credibility Dimension for Celebrity Endorsement Marketing and Its Influence on Consumers’ 
                        Purchase Decisions: A Focus on Sports Celebrity Endorsers.” This research was an exciting opportunity to dive 
                        deep into the intersection of marketing, consumer psychology, and the world of sports.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="article-subheader">Why This Topic?</h2>
                    <p class="article-content">
                        Celebrity endorsements are everywhere, especially in sports marketing, where athletes influence consumer behavior 
                        and shape brand perceptions. While much research focuses on a celebrity’s trustworthiness, expertise, and 
                        attractiveness, I noticed a gap—how personal life events and off-field behavior affect their credibility and, in 
                        turn, consumer purchase decisions. My goal was to bridge this gap by exploring the impact of these “in-real-life” 
                        factors.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="article-subheader">The Research Process</h2>
                    <p class="article-content">
                        I adopted a mixed-method approach, combining interviews with sports enthusiasts and a survey of over 120 respondents. 
                        Through thematic and statistical analyses, I unearthed fascinating insights: (1)Consumers highly value a sports celebrity’s 
                        personal traits and behavior, seeing these as crucial to their overall credibility. (2)Positive factors, like humility and fan engagement, 
                        boosted trust, while scandals and unethical behavior significantly damaged perceptions. (3)Importantly, these real-life factors often outweighed 
                        traditional attributes like expertise and attractiveness in shaping purchase decisions.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="article-subheader">Key Findings and Implications</h2>
                    <p class="article-content">
                        The study revealed that marketers need to go beyond the surface when choosing celebrity endorsers. A celebrity’s off-field image 
                        can make or break a campaign, influencing not just product perception but also the brand’s reputation. 
                        These findings are especially relevant in today’s connected world, where every action is amplified by social media.
