                    <p class="article-preview">Creating this web portfolio has been a rewarding journey of self-expression and technical 
                        growth. It’s not just a showcase of my projects—it's a reflection of my dedication to learning and my passion for 
                        growth.

                    <h2 class="article-subheader">Purpose and Vision</h2>
                    <p class="article-content">
                        My primary goal was to create an interactive platform to showcase my skills and projects while demonstrating the expertise 
                        I have gained through my work experience, personal projects, and online courses. As the job market becomes increasingly competitive, 
                        it is important to continuously develop oneself and present innovative ways to capture an employer's attention beyond the traditional 
                        recruitment process of submitting a resume and cover letter. Hence, I built this site with the vision of allowing recruiters, peers, 
                        and mentors to explore my journey and capabilities in greater detail.
                    </p>
                        
                    <h2 class="article-subheader">Tools and Technologies</h2>
                    <p class="article-content"> 
                        The portfolio is built using HTML and CSS, incorporating responsive design principles to ensure it looks great on any device. 
                        This is achieved through media queries, allowing the website to adapt seamlessly to smaller screens, such as tablets and phones. 
                        Initially, the portfolio also included JavaScript, featuring dropdown tabs like "More projects coming," found at the bottom of the 
                        articles tray. However, as I progressed with the build, I realized this functionality was unnecessary given the current number of 
                        articles, which did not justify using an array. That said, as I plan to expand my portfolio and include more projects, JavaScript 
                        will be reintroduced to enhance the user experience and create a more organized and interactive interface. To view the full code,

                    <h2 class="article-subheader">Challenges Faced</h2>
                    <p class="article-content">
                        One of the biggest challenges I faced was ensuring the site was fully responsive. While I successfully optimized the blog pages and the home page, 
                        there are still minor issues on the about page that prevent it from being fully responsive on smaller screens or phones. 
                        Another challenge was working with "display: flex;"—an incredibly useful but sometimes complex tool, especially when designing 
                        a heavily stylized portfolio. As reflected in the number of commits I made, a significant amount of refinement was required to perfect the 
                        layout and display of the portfolio. Through experimentation with other layout techniques, such as CSS Grid, I was able to achieve a 
                        design that met my expectations. While the process took time and required meticulous adjustments, the final result was a portfolio that 
                        aligned with my original vision.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="article-subheader">Features of the Portfolio</h2>
                    <p class="article-content">
                        A key feature of my portfolio is its responsive design, ensuring visitors can comfortably explore the site on any device. 
                        The portfolio includes a header banner with clickable elements that navigate to separate landing pages on the right, 
                        alongside my logo and name on the left. The website's UI was designed with screen reader accessibility in mind, making it inclusive 
                        for a wider audience. Additionally, I implemented fully responsive buttons and hover transitions to create a fluid and dynamic user 
                        experience. For the aesthetic, I opted for a minimal and clean design, inspired by websites like Forbes and The Telegraph.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="article-subheader">Outcome</h2>
                    <p class="article-content">
                        The creation of this portfolio involved a lot of trial and error, as well as challenges like compatibility issues and overlapping code that 
                        impacted the final design and layout. With patience and persistence, I was able to overcome these obstacles and achieve a cohesive result. 
                        This project also significantly boosted my confidence in using Git, particularly with managing absolute and relative file paths, 
                        pushing changes to origins, and committing repositories effectively. Looking ahead, I plan to enhance the portfolio further by implementing 
                        an array for the article tray, allowing users to render the full project list dynamically when interested. I also intend to incorporate a 
                        dropdown menu to hide header elements, creating a cleaner and more streamlined look. Additionally, I aim to add a dark mode 
                        (which I personally prefer) using the classList.toggle() method in JavaScript for a more customizable user experience.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="article-subheader">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p class="article-content">
                        Building this portfolio has been an incredible journey of growth and creativity. I’m excited to continue refining it as I learn more and take on new challenges. 
                        Feel free to explore, and I’d love to hear your feedback!
